# Blockchain Me

## What will this ÐApp do?
- Blockchain Me will use the ERC721 token standard as all tokens will be unique
- The ÐApp will allow users to store up to 10KB of data to the Ethereum blockchain. This idea is similar to (sending your name to the sun)[https://earthsky.org/space/send-your-name-to-sun-solar-probe] or (sending your name to mars)[https://mars.nasa.gov/participate/send-your-name/orion-first-flight/]. Possible things that a user could store include:
   - 256 x 256 image encoded in base64
   - Someone's name
   - A 10,000 character long excerpt
- This app is a good candidate for using the blockchain because the blockchain is unlikely to go down (as long as one person believes in Ethereum enough to host their own node). It is also a relatively cheap one time cost to save 10KB to the Ethereum blockchain (~$10). For information on costs, check out these sources:
   - https://ethgasstation.info/calculatorTxV.php - max gas per block is 6,700,000 which is estimated to cost $7.16 at the time of writing this
   - https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/872/what-is-the-cost-to-store-1kb-10kb-100kb-worth-of-data-into-the-ethereum-block?rq=1 - cost to store 1KB and 1GB from an answer from February 2016.
   - https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8m5hgh/whats_the_current_cost_to_store_1mb_of_data_on/ - cost to store 1MB onto the Ethereum blockchain, from May 2018.
- Blockchain Me will be a simple app that saves a string, within a token, to the blockchain, and allows the user to interact with a simple front end that will walk people through saving and view their information.
